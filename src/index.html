            >that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to
            quickly and easily style HTML elements. The framework is designed to

            One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
            consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
            can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
            ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
            <span> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 mb-5">
            Examples of such utility classes includes the
            <span>"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
            while the <span>"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a
            light gray background color to an element.

              a powerful and customizable CSS framework that promotes
              consistency in design and makes it easy to create responsive
              designs.
